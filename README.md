# Jademirror for projector hackaton

Our prototype for Projector-2022 hackaton

## What are we gonna do?

– This prototype will be able to transform and visualize graphs of different data

– How should it work?

  – A user writes smth in the search textbox and gets some nodes with data sources
  – Then he/she presses an "evolution" button, and the magic happens:
  
    – we download data from sources
    – we make NER of this data
    – we summarize this data
    – we find connections between the similar nodes
