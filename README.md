# Jademirror for projector hackaton

Our prototype for Projector-2022 hackaton

## Some info

– The hackaton will be held from Friday evening to Sunday, Feb 11 – 13

– Pls check the [description](https://projector2022.te-st.ru/)

## What are we gonna do?

– This prototype will be able to transform and visualize graphs of different data

– How should it work?

  – A user writes smth in the search textbox and gets some nodes with data sources
  – Then he/she presses an "evolution" button, and the magic happens:
  
    – we download data from sources
    – we make NER of this data
    – we find connections between the similar nodes
